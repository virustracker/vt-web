# Where is the interesting stuff

This is a copy of the website found under virustracker.ch. It's based on wordpress, so the most files are just the usual wordpress files. The only special thing is a small plugin found under **wp-includes/plugins/[virustracker](https://github.com/virustracker/vt-web/tree/master/wp-content/plugins/virustracker "virustracker")/**
Documentation of the plugin is directly in it's folder.
